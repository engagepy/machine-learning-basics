        <h2>Introduction To Machine Learning Basics</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. The process of machine learning is similar to that of data mining. Both systems search through data to look for patterns. However, instead of extracting data for human comprehension -- as is the case in data mining applications -- machine learning uses that data to detect patterns in data and adjust program actions accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>There are three types of machine learning:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="highlight">Supervised Learning</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Unsupervised Learning</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Reinforcement Learning</span></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
        <p>Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. It is the method of teaching the machine by example. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means some input data is already tagged with the correct output. The algorithm learns to map the input to the output and makes predictions based on the input data. The goal of supervised learning is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data, you can predict the output variables for that data.</p>

        <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels. The system is not told the "right answer." The algorithm must figure out what is being shown. The goal is to explore the data and find some structure within it. Unsupervised learning is used for clustering population in different groups.</p>

        <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task.</p>

        <h2>Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
        <p>There are several machine learning algorithms, and they can be broadly classified into three categories:</p>

        <h3>1. Supervised Learning Algorithms</h3>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions based on data. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type of machine learning has its own set of algorithms that can be used to make predictions based on data. Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into three categories: supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
